  <h2>object-fit: cover + object-position: # #</h2>
  <p>
    Allows image to be nudged for preferred focal to be visible. Accepts two
    values (x and y distance) however when image is bound by one parameter*, the
    input value would be ignored. I.e. if container definition is a shorter
    aspect ratio than source image, the y value will adjust the vertical
    alignment, but an x value input will be ignored.
  </p>
  <p>
    *When images and containers are set to fixed values and not %s, generally
    both values can used. Since most images we use are set to 100% width,
    generally only one parameter would have an impact.

              I have some incredible workers on my teams. Two of them &#8211;
              Saeed and Abdulaziz &#8211; started working with me a long time
              ago and they are very close to me. They know everything about
              digging. They understand the ground and the history of the place.
              They learn about digging techniques from their fathers and their
              fathers learned from their grandfathers. It&#8217;s in their
              family. I learn from them every day and they are always so proud
              to work with me. I want to thank them for teaching me so much.

  <h2>Using flex-boxes instead of tables to make the box heights match</h2>
  <p>
    One struggle I noticed was the mis-matched box heights using the standard
    table method. This can be avoided using flex-boxes, and even more complex
    layouts can use an align property set to stretch to fill a space.
  </p>
  <p>This example also uses a class defined as:</p>
  <pre>
    @media screen and (max-width: 980px) {
        .mobile-full-width {
            width: 100% !important;
        } 
    }
</pre
  >
  <p>
    If we could include a class like this somewhere in the program's css, it
    would allow us to more quickly adjust an element for mobile display.
    Whenever a width is defined as less than 100% (as the tables in the examples
    above were all set to 49% width), that width persists in mobile. If this
    class was inserted via <code>class="mobile-full-width"</code> in those same
    instances, the items would display at full device with when on small
    screens.
